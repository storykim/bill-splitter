## Is the number of transactions minimum?
**No. There is no guarantee that it would be minimal.** This application uses a na√Øve algorithm to reduce the number of transactions, and it is guaranteed that it would be less than the number of people. However, minimizing the number of transaction is actually [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) problem. To be specific, one can convert the problem into an optimization problem with integer constraint, which is not solved in polynomial time.
